# Food Adulteration Dataset
## Overview
This dataset contains information about food products, their brands, categories, detected adulterants, detection methods, severity of adulteration, health risks associated, and actions taken upon detection.

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following columns:

1. adulteration_id: Unique identifier for each adulteration incident.
2. product_name: Name of the food product adulterated.
3. brand: Brand of the adulterated product.
4. category: Category of the food product (e.g., Meat, Dairy).
5. adulterant: Substances used as adulterants.
6. detection_date: Date when the adulteration was detected.
7. detection_method: Method used to detect adulteration (e.g., Microbiological Analysis, Sensory Evaluation).
8. severity: Severity level of the adulteration (e.g., Moderate, Severe).
9. health_risk: Health risk associated with consumption (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
10. action_taken: Action taken upon detection (e.g., Product Recall, Warning Issued, Investigation Launched).

## Learning Outcomes
This dataset can be utilized for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks:
Supervised Learning: Predicting the health risk or severity based on product attributes.
Unsupervised Learning: Clustering products based on adulteration types or brands.

## Data Source
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle.
